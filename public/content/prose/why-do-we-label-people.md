# Why do we label people?

You're not your Myers-Briggs type. You're not your diagnosis. You're not your generation, your zodiac sign, your attachment style, your Hogwarts house.

Labels promise understanding - [a shortcut to knowing someone](#what-do-labels-promise). But they also [flatten people](#what-do-labels-cost) into static categories that don't actually exist. We reach for them because [they feel useful](#why-do-we-reach-for-them), but they're often [wrong in ways that matter](#are-labels-even-accurate). The alternative isn't chaos - it's [actually looking](#what-would-replace-them).

## What do labels promise?

- **Simplicity** - Instead of learning someone, you slot them into a category. Introvert. Type A. Anxious attachment. Done.
- **Prediction** - If I know your label, I know what to expect. No surprises.
- **Belonging** - I'm an INFJ. I'm a Millennial. I found my people.
- **Explanation** - Why am I like this? Because I'm [label]. Mystery solved.
- **Permission** - I can't help it, I'm a [label]. The label excuses the behavior.

Labels promise a world where people are legible. Knowable. Categorizable. Where you can skip the actual work of understanding someone and jump straight to assumptions.

## What do labels cost?

- **Flattening** - You're not one thing. You're different with different people, in different contexts, on different days. The label picks one slice and calls it the whole.
- **Self-fulfilling prophecy** - Once you believe you're "bad at math" or "not creative" or "avoidant," you stop trying. The label becomes the ceiling.
- **Dismissal** - "Oh, that's just how [Boomers/Zoomers/introverts/engineers] are." The label replaces curiosity.
- **Weaponization** - Labels become ammunition. You're so [label]. Typical [label] behavior. The label is the insult.
- **Essentialism** - The label implies permanence. You ARE this thing. Not "you're currently exhibiting this pattern in this context."

The cost is seeing people as fixed when they're actually fluid. As simple when they're actually complex. As predictable when they're actually surprising.

## Why do we reach for them?

Because understanding people is hard. Genuinely hard.

Every person is a novel. Their history, their context, their internal experience, their contradictions - it takes time and attention to actually see someone. Labels are the CliffsNotes.

And sometimes that's fine. You don't need to deeply understand the barista. Surface-level categories work for surface-level interactions.

But we use them for close relationships too. For ourselves. For entire groups of people we've never met. We use the shortcut when the shortcut costs too much.

## Are labels even accurate?

Myers-Briggs has the scientific validity of a horoscope. Your "type" changes depending on your mood when you take the test.

Attachment styles were developed by observing infants. Applying them to adult romantic relationships is a metaphor, not a measurement.

Generational labels (Boomer, Gen X, Millennial, Gen Z) are marketing categories that describe ~15-year spans containing hundreds of millions of people with almost nothing in common except being alive at the same time.

Even clinical diagnoses - the most rigorous labels we have - are shifting consensus categories, not discovered truths. The DSM changes every edition. Yesterday's disorder is today's normal is tomorrow's disorder again.

Labels aren't descriptions of reality. They're simplification tools that sometimes correlate with patterns. The map, mistaken for the territory.

## What about useful labels?

Some labels do work. They point at real patterns. They help people find community, get accommodations, understand themselves.

The problem isn't labels existing. It's labels replacing understanding.

"I have ADHD" can mean "here's a framework that helps me understand my patterns and get support." Or it can mean "this is my identity and explains everything about me forever."

The first is a tool. The second is a cage.

## What would replace them?

Not "no categories ever." That's impossible. We need concepts to think with.

But: holding them loosely. Treating them as hypotheses, not facts. Remembering that the person in front of you is not the label you've applied to them.

**Actually looking.** What is this specific person doing, in this specific context, right now? Not what would "an introvert" do - what is *this person* doing?

**Asking instead of assuming.** "What's going on for you?" rather than "I know what's going on because I know your type."

**Allowing change.** People aren't static. The person you knew five years ago might be different now. The label you applied might not fit anymore. Maybe it never did.

**Noticing the function.** When you reach for a label, ask: what work is this doing? Is it helping me see clearly, or helping me avoid looking?

## Why does this matter?

Because people live inside the labels others put on them. And the labels they put on themselves.

The kid labeled "gifted" who can't handle struggle because struggle means they're not gifted anymore.

The adult labeled "anxious" who stops trying to change because the label says this is just who they are.

The employee labeled "not leadership material" who never gets opportunities to lead.

Labels don't just describe. They prescribe. They constrain. They become the story people believe about themselves and each other.

And maybe those stories are wrong. Maybe there's more there than the label allows.
