exo is a collection of projects about places to exist — digital spaces where identity, narrative, and interaction intersect.

## What it is

Where rhi focuses on software infrastructure, exo focuses on the human layer: roleplay, identity exploration, and persistent fictional worlds. The projects here provide tools for building and inhabiting digital spaces with rich character systems and emergent narrative.

## What it isn't

- Not social media — the focus is on collaborative storytelling, not content feeds

## Projects

- [hologram](/hologram) — Discord bot for entity-based roleplay with knowledge graph and RAG
- [aspect](/aspect) — card-based identity exploration sandbox
