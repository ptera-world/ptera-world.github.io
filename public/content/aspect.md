Card-based identity exploration sandbox.

## What it is

A tool for exploring and expressing identity through collectible cards. Each card represents a facet — a personality trait, aesthetic preference, value, or role — and you build a deck that represents who you are or who you want to be.

The card system supports:

- **Facets** — individual identity dimensions represented as cards
- **Decks** — curated collections that represent a persona or mood
- **Spreads** — layouts that reveal relationships between facets
- **Evolution** — tracking how identity shifts over time

## What it isn't

- Not a personality test — it's exploratory, not diagnostic
- Not a trading card game — cards represent identity facets, not game mechanics
- Not social media — it's personal exploration, not public performance
