CLI tool that captures and structures anything you pipe into it. Local SQLite graph database. No UI, no dashboard — just memory.

## What it is

A stdin sink that turns unstructured input into structured, linked, searchable data. Pipe anything in — command output, text, URLs — and pad figures out the shape, stores it in a local graph, and links it together.

Extensions let it live wherever you work: shell, clipboard, browser, git, vscode/vim. Core is built in Lua with bundled LuaJIT and SQLite.

## Philosophy

A membrane between human activity and persistent structure. It doesn't help. It doesn't assist. It doesn't chat. It just remembers.
