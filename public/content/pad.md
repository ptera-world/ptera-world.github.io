Pipe anything in, get structure out. Local SQLite graph, no UI - just memory.

## What it is

Anything you pipe into pad gets structured, linked, and saved. Command output, text, URLs - pad figures out the shape and stores it in a local graph. Everything connects together, nothing gets lost.

Extensions let it live wherever you work: shell, clipboard, browser, git, vscode/vim. Built in Lua with bundled LuaJIT and SQLite.

## Philosophy

It doesn't help. It doesn't assist. It doesn't chat. It just remembers.
