Discord bot for entity-based roleplay with knowledge graph and RAG.

## What it is

A Discord bot that enables collaborative roleplay with persistent entities. Characters, locations, items, and events are stored in a knowledge graph. When players interact, hologram uses retrieval-augmented generation to maintain consistency with established lore.

Key features:

- **Entity system** — characters and world elements with text-based definitions
- **Knowledge graph** — relationships between entities tracked and queryable
- **RAG** — AI responses grounded in established world knowledge
- **Session management** — separate roleplay contexts within the same server
