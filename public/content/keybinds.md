Keyboard shortcuts for the web, defined as data. Zero dependencies.

## What it is

A small JavaScript library for keybindings. You describe your shortcuts as plain objects and keybinds handles the rest - matching keys, respecting context, letting users rebind things.

- **Schema-driven** - bindings are data, not imperative listeners
- **Context-aware** - commands activate based on app state
- **User-rebindable** - overrides persist to localStorage
- **Discoverable** - ships with `<command-palette>` and `<keybind-cheatsheet>` web components
