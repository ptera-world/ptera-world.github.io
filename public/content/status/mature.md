stable and actively maintained.

## what it is

mature projects have settled into their purpose: they work, they're documented, they solve the problem they were built for. not finished in the sense of abandoned - actively used and maintained, evolving when needed. the core functionality is solid enough to build on.

these are the ones you can depend on without worrying about breaking changes every week.
